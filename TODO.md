# Todo
- Add a "you just logged in from a new IP" email if their new login ip isnt found in the login_history table.

- Create account page which lets a user update their email, password and terminate all other sessions
- Add basic CRUD homepage/demo functionality. Like a notes app or something.

- Add e2e tests using playwright? At least cover all the auth related stuff and run them in Nuke before completing.
- Do a final pass on all the auth stuff based on OWASP checklists.
