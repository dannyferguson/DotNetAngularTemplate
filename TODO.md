# Todo
- Figure out why sign out after logging in without refreshing the page doesnt work (probably CSRF cookie issue).
- Add e2e tests using playwright? At least cover all the auth related stuff and run them in Nuke before completing.

- Create account page which lets a user update their email, password and terminate all other sessions
- Add basic CRUD homepage/demo functionality. Like a notes app or something.
- Do a final pass on all the auth stuff based on OWASP checklists.
- Remove tailwind branding + slightly customize default theme.
