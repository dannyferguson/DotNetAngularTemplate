# Todo

- Create account page which lets a user update their email, password and terminate all other sessions
- Add basic CRUD homepage/demo functionality. Like a notes app or something.
- Setup email verification. Deny login without valid email, require new login after updating email.
- Add environment URL for domain? So that you can easily use that for emails and such.
- See if you can build email templates easily and use those in Resend while replacing placeholders.
- Do a final pass on all the auth stuff based on OWASP checklists.
- Remove tailwind branding + slightly customize default theme.
- Maybe: Move to vertical slices organization? For both Angular and .NET
- Maybe: MediatR? would clean up the controllers
- Maybe: Keep db services clean of implementations, move those to controllers or MediatR handlers?
