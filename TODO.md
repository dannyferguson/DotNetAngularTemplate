# Todo

- Add e2e tests using playwright? At least cover all the auth related stuff and run them in Nuke before completing
- Create account page which lets a user update their email, password and terminate all other sessions
- Add basic CRUD homepage/demo functionality. Like a notes app or something.
- Setup email verification. Deny login without valid email, require new login after updating email.
- Add environment URL for domain? So that you can easily use that for emails and such.
- See if you can build email templates easily and use those in Resend while replacing placeholders.
- Do a final pass on all the auth stuff based on OWASP checklists.
- Remove tailwind branding + slightly customize default theme.
