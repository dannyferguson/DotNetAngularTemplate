# Todo
- Add a "you just logged in from a new IP" email if their new login ip isnt found in the login_history table.
- Add basic CRUD homepage/demo functionality. Like a notes app or something.

- Create account page which lets a user update their email, password and terminate all other sessions
- Do a final pass on all the auth stuff based on OWASP checklists.

- Finish adding automated tests for missing pages + wire it up to run in CI/nuke build.
